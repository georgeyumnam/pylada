Compiling and installing
========================

The source code for pylada can be obtained from github_. 

Requirements
------------

- cmake_: software tool to configure and create the makefiles. Any
  version 2.8 and larger should work. This program is often available on
  supercomputers *via* ``module load cmake``.

- Boost_: A set of high-performance C++ libraries. Most of these
  libraries contain only header files. Hence, they can be installed
  rather easily. However, Pylada does require as many as two compiled
  package: python, and the math package when compiling Pylada's Ewald
  functional. PyLada uses the following header-only libraries: mpl,
  enable if, type traits, preprocessor, bind, ref, static assert,
  exceptions. Most Linux distributions will contain Boost in some rpm of
  deb package. It is often not available on supercomputers and will need
  to be installed there. 

  .. note::

     Pylada also uses ``boost.mpi`` in some of its default configuration
     scripts. It is a python package which interface with the MPI
     library.  It is not strictly required and other MPI package could
     replace it in the relevant config files.
 
- Eigen_: An efficient C++ numerical library. This is a header-only
  library which is fairly easy to install with CMake. Versions 2 and 3
  are supported.

- Python_: programming language with which to interface with Pylada.
  Should be between version 2.6.4 included and 3.0 excluded. Python_ is
  likely available by default on any unix system. 

- Numpy_: a Python_ package for numerical calculations. It is available
  on all Linux distributions. It is often time available by default on
  supercomputers. If not, it can be installed *via* easy_install_ or
  pip_. 

- quantities_: A Python_ package which implements physical dimensions and
  units, such as length, weight, etc. It works well with Numpy_. It is
  unlikely to be installed by default on any system. It can be installed
  easily with easy_install_ or pip_.

- IPython_: an interactive shell for Python_. It forms the basis of
  Pylada's user-interface. It must be version 0.13 or higher. It can be
  installed in its simplest form without any of its optional
  dependencies. This package will not likely to be found installed by
  default. It can be installed easily with easy_install_ or pip_.

- Scipy_: It is only required to relax structures with the
  :py:mod:`Valence Force Field <lada.vff>` functional. In that case,
  version 0.11 or higher is required. A Python_ package for scientific
  computing.  It is available on all Linux distributions. It is often
  time available by default on supercomputers. If not, it can be
  installed *via* easy_install_ or pip_. 

- sphinx_: Only required to create the documentation. Can be installed
  *via* easy_install_ or pip_. 

- ctest_: Only required to run the test suite. It is distributed with
  cmake_.

Recommended
-----------

- matplotlib_: A Python_ package to make nice plots. Not strictly
  required, but it will enable users to plot Pylada generated results
  easily. Can be installed *via* easy_install_ or pip_. It is included in
  all Linux distributions.

Procedure
---------

On a unix machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following assumes the required packages listed above are installed.
It also assumes that the source code for Pylada has extracted to some
directory.

.. code-block:: bash

   > cd directory/with/pylada/source
   > mkdir build
   > cd build
   > cmake ..

The code above will create a directory where all compilation objects will
be stored. It moves to that directory and runs cmake_ once. At this point
we have a configured system. 

To enable different Pylada sub-packages and to fine tune the configuration, do: 

.. code-block:: bash

   > ccmake ..

This will load up a somewhat graphical interface to cmake. You can
navigate using the down and up arrows, edit a line using [ENTER] (and the
left/right arrows, [TAB], ...), search for specific term using [/]...

It is recommended to set:

  - CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: Release
  - CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: /some/path/where/to/install/lada

Pylada's subpackages (VASP_ wrapper, ipython_ interface,...) can be
enabled using ``ccmake``.  Once you have modified the two variables
above and chosen which sub-package to enable, hit [c] to configure, and
then [g] to generate the resulting makefiles. You may need to hit [c] and
[g] multiple times. Eventually, it will drop you to the bash prompt. 

.. code-block:: bash

   > make
   > make install

The last two lines should see you through the installation.


.. warning:

  cmake_ and Python_ don't always interact well. You may want to do the
  following:

  .. code-block:: bash
     
     > ccmake ..
  
  Then hit [t] for advanced options. Hit [/] followed by
  [PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR] to look.  This will bring you to
  ``PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR``. You should make sure that it points to the
  correct python version. Also check ``PYTHON_LIBRARY``. cmake_ often
  picks up different version of python on a system.

Checking your installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a python shell, try importing `pylada`:

>>> import pylada

If you have an error, then python does not know how to find the directory
where Pylada was installed. Make sure that `python is is set up
correctly`__ to include this directory. In general, it is defined by
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and CMAKE_PYINSTALL_PREFIX.

.. __: http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path

Once the above works: 

.. code-block:: bash

   > cd path/to/pylad/source
   > cd build
   > make test

This will run Pylada's unit-tests.  It may take some time. Hopefully,
most tests will run. Note that some tests for VASP_, CRYSTAL_, and such,
will require that Pylada be configure first, e.g., told how to find the
relevant programs.


Creating the documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This documentation is generated using sphinx_. Assuming that python can
find the Pylada installation, the documentation can be generated with:
 
.. code-block:: bash

   > cd path/to/pylada/source
   > cd sphinx-doc
   > make html

This will create a directory "build/html" with an "index.html" file. View
it with your favorite browser and voil√†!


.. note::
  
   Virtualenv users will want to do ``pip install sphinx`` to make sure
   that sphinx is started using the virtualenv python. 

Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unices with gnu compiler, intel compiler, but not Portland compiler (eigen
does not compile). Known to work on Mac OS/X.
