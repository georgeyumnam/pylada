""" Classes and functions pertaining to job-management. 

    Jobs are described within job-dictionaries. These dictionaries resemble
    directory trees, where some directories contain input files (eg job
    parameters) and are marked for execution.

    In addition, this package contains classes, such as MassExtract and
    JobParams, capable of navigating output and input from jobdictionaries.
