   PyLaDa is a high throughput computational platform for Physics. It aims to make it easier to submit
   large numbers of jobs on supercomputers. It provides a python interface to physical input, such as
   crystal structures, as well as to a number of DFT (VASP, CRYSTAL) and atomic potential programs. It
   is able to organise and launch computational jobs on PBS and SLURM.
