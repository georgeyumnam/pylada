<h1>About<a class="headerlink" href="#about" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>Pylada is a modular python framework to control physics simulations, from DFT to
empirical pseudo-potentials to point ion electrostatics. It&#8217;s goal is to
provide the basic building blocks from which methods incorporating different
Hamiltonians can be constructed. It is designed around three main concepts:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>constructing and manipulating periodic crystal structures. For instance, it
is possible, starting from the unit cell of spinel to automatically create
a supercell with vacancies or substitutions.</li>
<li>manipulating functionals, such as VASP, and extracting their output. For
instance, one could throw diamond at VASP, expect it to relax the
structure, then perform a static calculation for maximum accuracy. Or
possibly perform an epitaxial relaxation, something VASP does not do
per say.</li>
<li>Manipulate, launch, and check the results for thousands of calculations
simultaneously. Think of calculating different of carbone allotropes. It
would be impractical to qsub each and every job and then check that each
ran correctly. Hence, Pylada provides an interface for that.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>With these building blocks in hand, it is possible, fairly easy, and - I&#8217;m told
- even fun,  to construct complex computational routines. Computing phonons or
formation enthalpy requires some know-how, certainly. But it is also quite
repetitive. Pylada takes the gruelling out of it.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the projects Pylada helped us with.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><em>When brute force suffices:</em> A<sub>2</sub>BX<sub>4</sub> (A, B cations, X=O, S,
Se, Te) form a vast family of compounds crystallizing in forty different
structures. However, hundreds of possible combinations of A, B, X have
never been identified in nature before. Do these exist and have simply
never been reported? Or are they thermodynamically unstable and could never
have been found? To answer this question, we systematically computed the
formation enthalpy of hundreds of unknown A<sub>2</sub>BX<sub>4</sub> as well
as that of their (reported) competing binaries and ternaries. We found
indeed quite a few compounds, some which may be fairly easily grown, which
simply passed through the sieve. Pylada made it a sinch to perform these
individual calculations. It allowed us to shove them in a database and then
scour the data to automatically create phase diagrams for each system.</li>
<li><em>Stay abstract and leave off mano a mano calculations:</em> One of the goals of
the project described above was to explore stable A<sub>2</sub>BX<sub>4</sub>
for semi-conducting properties. More specifically, we were interested in
predicting whether these compounds can be doped and how much. Or whether
some point defects intrinsic to the material would form spontaneously when
external dopants are introduced and limit the material&#8217;s carrier
concentration. To do this, we created a simple script to automatically
determine possible vacancies and substitutions, as well as their charge
state. These defects are all <a class="reference external" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0965-0393/17/8/084002">the same</a>, so no need to worry and create
each, one at a time.  Pylada made it possible to create the systems, launch
the appropriate chain of calculations, and gather the results, and let
physicists do physics rather than word processing input files.</li>
<li><em>Manipulating DFT functionals:</em> <a class="reference external" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.77.241201">This DFT functional</a> was introduced to
reproduce GW band-structures. It works by fitting a non-local potential.
Originally, each fit would be performed by hand for each element. It turned
out to be tedious. Especially since for more complicated compounds one
would rather fit all the elements involved simultaneously. But Pylada offers
python wrappers around DFT codes, and python offers a number of
optimization functions. The two together make it possible to carry out
painless optimization of a empirical DFT functional.</li>
<li><em>Searching for and finding a needle:</em> Silicon is a possibly God&#8217;s greatest gift
for nerds everywhere. It is n-type. It is p-type. It naturally forms a
protective insulating oxide layer. However, it is an indirect gap material
and absorbs visible light only through the mediation of phonons. It has
been known for a while that it is possible to create Si/Ge superlattices
which are nominally direct gap. Indeed, Si<sub>6</sub>Ge<sub>4</sub> on a
strained (001) substrate absorb light at the band edges. But only
academically so. It is possible that a superlattice with specific motif and
Si and Ge layer with meaningful photon absorption exists somewhere, but
there a literally billions upon trillions of possibilities. So which one to
start off with? At that point, research tapered off. We combined an
empirical pseudo-potential method with a genetic algorithm to perform the
search for us. Eventually, the search <a class="reference external" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.027401">payed off</a>.</li>
<li><em>screwing up:</em> Speaking from painful and embarrassing personal experience,
it is extremely easy to launch tens and hundreds of meaningless jobs. The
physics is still for the user to figure out.</li>
